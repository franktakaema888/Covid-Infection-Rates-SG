# Project Title: Exploring the Effects of Government Policies and Vaccination Rates on COVID-19 Infection Rates in Singapore

## Overview

This project explores the impact of government policies and vaccination rates on COVID-19 infection rates in Singapore. Using data science techniques, the project aims to analyze how government interventions, such as vaccinations and public health measures, have influenced infection trends during the pandemic. 

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project include:
1. Investigating the correlation between vaccination rates and COVID-19 infection rates.
2. Examining the effects of government policies on both vaccination and infection rates over specific time periods.
3. Evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and drawing insights into how similar measures can be applied for future pandemics.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this analysis were sourced from:
- [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/)
- Local news publications like *The Straits Times* and *Today Online*.

These datasets provide:
- COVID-19 infection rates in Singapore.
- Vaccination rates in Singapore.
- Information on the government policies implemented during the pandemic.

## Methodology

The analysis follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Collection:** Data is collected from government websites and local news sources.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** The datasets are cleaned and prepared for analysis by handling missing values and standardizing formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Basic visualizations and statistical techniques are used to understand the distribution of vaccination and infection rates.
4. **Correlation & Trend Analysis:** The relationship between vaccination rates, infection rates, and government policies is analyzed.
5. **Conclusion:** Based on the findings, the study draws conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions and potential applications for future public health crises.

## Key Findings

- **Vaccination Impact:** Higher vaccination rates are correlated with lower infection rates, particularly after certain government interventions were introduced.
- **Government Policy:** Lockdowns and phased reopening strategies had a significant impact on reducing infection rates, in conjunction with increasing vaccination rates.
- **Ethical Considerations:** The data used complies with legal usage rights and does not involve any personal or sensitive information.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data handling and visualization)

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/covid-vaccination-analysis.git
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Covid_infection.ipynb
    ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Results

- The analysis found that the government's timely intervention with vaccination drives and policies such as lockdowns contributed significantly to controlling the COVID-19 infection rates in Singapore.
- The project highlights the importance of vaccination in mitigating infection spread and offers insights for future policy development.

## Ethical Considerations

The project adheres to all legal and ethical guidelines:
- Data from official government sites and publications is used within permitted boundaries.
- The analysis does not promote any harmful assumptions or political agendas.

## Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between vaccination rates, government policies, and COVID-19 infection rates. The findings provide valuable insights that can be applied in future pandemic preparedness strategies.
